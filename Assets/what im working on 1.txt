what I'm working on right now:
importante: maybe apply physically based shading techniques as those described by megan walker in her thesis "REALISTIC AGING OF MATERIALS IN COMPUTER GRAPHICS"

UI logger or tooltip to stop and tell of problems/illegal actions without breaking the software
defaults for unfilled inputfields should just be zero...?
ability to remove UI parts (press little x to delete, ez)
finishing building also moves it in world space... now with a magic number instead
why can we sometimes draw the custom base panel, outside of the panel? should not work. 
make roof textures coherent across triangles.. (on top of the fancy roof for example)
some sort of limit on the length of the inset of fancy roof so they dont cross one another
fancy roof doesnt work if wall itself does not have a mesh filter on its component...
rotation of gameobject is not maintained in finalization step

maybe add functionality to make future objects not spawn on me... like on te grid for example..? idk tho cuz that fucks up labels. hm
we have to figure out how to scale the noise properly. fuck
noise sometimes onto non-meshrenderer breaks stuff (e.g. no selection)
