what I'm working on right now:
make sure extra shape does not get created when doing already existing mesh. altho... hmm... it only gets created because we're also selecting the parent construction shape that's also along the grid... right?
now just fix the extra shape, then make a defaut testing ground with ready-made background and windows (with labels...) so we can actually makethe damage and age thing work. ok?
now is the time to try to clean stuff up, implement small easy things, see if there is anything left in terms of selex, and then remove things from the UI that won't be added

importante: maybe apply physically based shading techniques as those described by megan walker in her thesis "REALISTIC AGING OF MATERIALS IN COMPUTER GRAPHICS"

adding shapes against non-grid background puts them in the wrong place - hello new me here. and the reasoning is quite simple - basically, it has to do with the origin point of the object its being created on top of. grids have their origin in bottom left, 
other objects have it in the middle

winding order of drawing should not change what side faces outwards
making root(1) and root into custom bases getsdifferent results
"now hooking up selex panel with id -122950 as a child to the gameobject with id -122950" fuck
UI logger or tooltip to stop and tell of problems/illegal actions without breaking the software
reset button so you dont have to restart entire program (just reload scene?)
defaults for unfilled inputfields should just be zero...?
nex step: take pictures of transforms

you cant really make mistakes, ... cuz i have no support for undoing things, so if you make a mistake, you have to start all over....
maybe add functionality to make future objects not spawn on me... like on te grid for example..? idk tho cuz that fucks up labels. hm. this is interesting though, cuz altho i at first thought ui would be better than text based, with the UI, u can't "copy paste" the state you are in, so if you mess up, you cant copy the string, restart the program and paste the string. you have to start over. so usability not necessarily better
