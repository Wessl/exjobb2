what I'm working on right now:
make sure extra shape does not get created when doing already existing mesh. altho... hmm... it only gets created because we're also selecting the parent construction shape that's also along the grid... right?
now just fix the extra shape, then make a defaut testing ground with ready-made background and windows (with labels...) so we can actually makethe damage and age thing work. ok?
now is the time to try to clean stuff up, implement small easy things, see if there is anything left in terms of selex, and then remove things from the UI that won't be added

why does applying noise to the root1 sample scene work but not to a newly created one? 
the reason why it creates a big extra window is because the facade itself is included - but why is it so big? it shouldn't be

let's think about how to make adding things like windows to grid scale according to area and not have to put in specific values each time. 
but also, why the fuck are they construction shapes. line 230 addshape
