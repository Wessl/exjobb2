what I'm working on right now:
make sure extra shape does not get created when doing already existing mesh. altho... hmm... it only gets created because we're also selecting the parent construction shape that's also along the grid... right?
now just fix the extra shape, then make a defaut testing ground with ready-made background and windows (with labels...) so we can actually makethe damage and age thing work. ok?
now is the time to try to clean stuff up, implement small easy things, see if there is anything left in terms of selex, and then remove things from the UI that won't be added

let's think about how to make adding things like windows to grid scale according to area and not have to put in specific values each time. 
I think the way to do it is to include a way to simply check a box that says "scale against parent"
this would replace the normal "width" and "height" parameters with "inset x % (from each side)" and "inset y %"
- are there any problems with this? 
* it doesn't work on the root
- benefits?
* it will work on every element selected in a grid, so strange, uneven grids can still get some nice windows
