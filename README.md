# Procedural Building Facade Generation in Unity

### About
This project is made for my master thesis at KTH Royal Institute of Technology. 

I will investigate procedurally generating building facades in Unity. Theoretically, some of it is based on the following paper: [Selection Expressions for Procedural Modeling](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/328484066_Selection_Expressions_for_Procedural_Modeling). Once I'm done with the actual paper, I'll link it here to give an overview of all the background and more. 

### Unity
I am using Unity version 2020.3.29f1 (LTS).
