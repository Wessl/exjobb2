# Procedural Building Facade Generation in Unity

### About
This project is made for my master thesis at KTH Royal Institute of Technology. 

I will investigate procedurally generating building facades in Unity. Theoretically, much of it is based on the following paper: [Selection Expressions for Procedural Modeling](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/328484066_Selection_Expressions_for_Procedural_Modeling). I hope to achieve scientific novelty by implementing the methods in Unity, which has not yet been done, as well as performing many forms of evaluations that the original authors did not do. 

### Unity
I am using Unity version 2020.3.29f1 (LTS).
